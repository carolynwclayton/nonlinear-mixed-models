The main document of interest is titled "Thesis Final.pdf". This is an introduction to nonlinear mixed models, pharmacokinetic models, NONMEM, model building, and a full simple example analysis of a dataset in NONMEM.

The file titled "Defense.pptx" is the PowerPoint used as a summary of the project.
